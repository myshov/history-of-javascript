# History of JavaScript

About a year ago I had prepared talk about Modularity In JS. Then after some time I had decided to write article on this topic. It was a really fun process. To do the article more legit I contacted with stellar people from JS community and TC39 on twitter. In the process of research of JS modularity I figured out other facts about history of JS, that can be interesting to someone else.

Anyway the knowing of history of anything can give us a lot in the perspective and it's always interesting to know what persons are stand behind the particular technology. So I've decided to write a series of independent articles about JavaScript history. And who knows maybe in the future it will become a book. Anyway for me personally it's fun to figure out some facts and to learn something new about technology that I use everyday.

There is only one article at this moment ;). Because I write in my spare time and this process is not so fast as I would wanted.

Nevertheless, current plan is a series of this articles:

1. Early Years of JavaScript (empty)
2. Short History of UI Toolkits (empty)
3. Rise of MVC (empty)
4. [Evolution of JS Modularity](https://github.com/myshov/history-of-javascript/tree/master/4_evolution_of_js_modularity)
5. Bundlers as They Are (empty)
6. Let's Transpile It (empty)
7. Functional JavaScript (empty)
8. Asynchronous JS: Fight with Complexity (work in progress)

Let's figure out the history of an emerging one of the most prevalent technologies to date.

P.S. As I am not native English speaker you can find some grammatical or other issues don't hesitate to help me out and do pull request with fixes ;)
